## CrescendoMeow's Journal of English as a Second Language (CMJESL)

The files under this folder record the random pieces in my ESL life. Some pieces are tech/academia-related; others are appliable for general audience. Inspired by the naming philosophy of academic journals, the files named as `cmjesl_vol_20xx.md` hold the records of that year. Meanwhile, the files named as `cmjesl_vol_sp_yyyy.md` hold the records under the special topics.

Mr. Ao Li (李敖) wrote a book titled [《坐牢家爸爸给女儿的八十封信》](https://book.douban.com/subject/1073072/) in 1970s. That book includes a lot of interesting essays about the nuance of English and Chinese. This *fake* journal edited by CrescendoMeow tries to imitate Mr. Ao Li naively yet sincerely.
