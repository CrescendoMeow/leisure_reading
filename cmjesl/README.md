## CrescendoMeow's Journal of English as a Second Language (CMJESL)

The posts here contain the random pieces in my ESL life. Some pieces are related to the academic research or general technology in computer science, others are applicable for more general audience. The following volumes are available now, i.e.

- [Vol 2022](https://github.com/CrescendoMeow/leisure_reading/blob/main/cmjesl/cmjesl_vol_2022.md)
- [Vol 2020](https://github.com/CrescendoMeow/leisure_reading/blob/main/cmjesl/cmjesl_vol_2020.md)
- [Vol 2019](https://github.com/CrescendoMeow/leisure_reading/blob/main/cmjesl/cmjesl_vol_2019.md)
- [Vol 2018](https://github.com/CrescendoMeow/leisure_reading/blob/main/cmjesl/cmjesl_vol_2018.md)
- [Vol 2017](https://github.com/CrescendoMeow/leisure_reading/blob/main/cmjesl/cmjesl_vol_2017.md)
- [Vol 2016](https://github.com/CrescendoMeow/leisure_reading/blob/main/cmjesl/cmjesl_vol_2016.md)
- [Vol 2015](https://github.com/CrescendoMeow/leisure_reading/blob/main/cmjesl/cmjesl_vol_2015.md)
- [Special Vol on English Names | 英文名趣谈](https://github.com/CrescendoMeow/leisure_reading/blob/main/cmjesl/cmjesl_vol_sp_name.md)

The volume naming is inspired by the naming philosophy of academic journals, i.e.

- `cmjesl_vol_20xx.md` stores the pieces in the corresponding year.
- `cmjesl_vol_sp_yyyy.md` curates the special topics.

Mr. Ao Li (李敖) wrote a book titled [《坐牢家爸爸给女儿的八十封信》](https://book.douban.com/subject/1073072/) in 1970s. That book includes a lot of interesting essays about the nuance of English and Chinese. This *fake* journal edited by CrescendoMeow tries to imitate Mr. Ao Li's old book naively yet sincerely.
