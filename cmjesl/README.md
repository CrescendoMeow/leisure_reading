## CrescendoMeow's Journal of English as a Second Language (CMJESL)

The files under this folder record the random pieces when using English in my daily life. Some pieces are tech/academia-related; others target at general audience. Inspired by the naming philosophy of academic journals, most files are named as `cmjesl_vol_20xx.md` and hold the records of that year. Other files are named as `cmjesl_vol_sp_yyyy.md` and hold the records under the special topics.

Mr. Ao Li (李敖) wrote a book titled [《坐牢家爸爸给女儿的八十封信》](https://book.douban.com/subject/1073072/) in 1970s. That book includes a lot of interesting essays about the nuance of English and Chinese. This *fake* journal edited by CrescendoMeow tries to imitate Mr. Ao Li naively yet sincerely.
