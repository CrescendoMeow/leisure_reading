## CrescendoMeow's Journal of English as a Second Language (CMJESL)

The files here contain the random pieces in my ESL life. Some pieces are tech/academia-related, others are appliable for general audience. 

Inspired by the naming philosophy of academic journals, 
- `cmjesl_vol_20xx.md` stores the pieces in the corresponding year. 
- `cmjesl_vol_sp_yyyy.md` curates the special topics.

Mr. Ao Li (李敖) wrote a book titled [《坐牢家爸爸给女儿的八十封信》](https://book.douban.com/subject/1073072/) in 1970s. That book includes a lot of interesting essays about the nuance of English and Chinese. This *fake* journal edited by CrescendoMeow tries to imitate Mr. Ao Li naively yet sincerely.

If you have any comments or suggestions, welcome to go to the `Discussions` and leave messages under the corresponding thread.
