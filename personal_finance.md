###  6.2. <a name='Bond'></a>Bond

- It can be viewed as a loan to investors. The investor does not receive stock ownership in the company, but they do receive an interest payment.
- “Fixed-income Assets”
- Bonds are safer because corporations are required by law to pay back bond investors before stock investors in the event of bankruptcy.
- But that doesn’t make bonds risk free. Bonds are rated for credit quality by a credit rating agency such as Moody’s or Standard and Poor’s to help investors gauge their risk. Investment-grade bonds typically have a rating of A, AA, or AAA.
- Pay attention to the commission or markup when buying the bond. It may not as transparent as that when you buy stock or mutual fund.

###  6.3. <a name='Stock'></a>Stock
- When you buy stock, you buy ownership in a company and in effect tie your financial future to theirs. 
- Stocks tend to be riskier than bonds because you are not guaranteed that the stock will do well, but you also have the opportunity to enjoy greater growth on your money.
- Initial Public Offering (IPO): The first time a company sells stock.
- Stock returns arise from (1) capital gains (i.e. buying at low and selling at high) and (2) dividends (i.e. the share of profit that a company distributes to its shareholders)
  - Conservative investors may prefer to generate most of their returns from dividends rather than capital gains. They would prefer stocks which have a long history of paying substantial dividends.
  - Aggressive investors may prefer to generate most of their returns from capital gains rather than dividends. They should have a higher tolerance of risk.

###  6.4. <a name='Fund'></a>Fund

- Mutual Fund
  - The investors pool their money to buy a collection or portfolio of assets. The money in the pool is managed by a fund manager who decides what assets to buy and sell based on the fund’s objectives.
  - Mutual funds may own stocks, but they’re not the same as stocks. When you buy shares in a mutual fund, you don’t actually own shares of the stock it invests in, you own a piece of the fund itself.
  - [Net Asset Value (NAV)](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/032604.asp)
    - it’s calculated by dividing the total value of the assets in the fund’s portfolio by the number of outstanding shares.
    - Mutual funds aren’t traded on the stock exchange. It will not change throughout the day like a stock price; it updates at the end of each trading day. So, a listed NAV price is actually the price as of yesterday's close. But an order you put in will be based on the updated NAV at the end of the current trading day. As a result, you may not know the exact NAV when you buy or sell shares. **When you place an order to buy or sell mutual fund shares, the order is filled after the market closes and the NAV is determined.**
  - Different types of mutual funds: Mutual funds can invest in any asset class, so you can find, i.e.
    - bond funds,
    - stock funds, or equity funds,
    - money market funds,
    - funds that invest in commodities such as precious metals or oil and gas, 
    - foreign exchange (forex) funds,
    - real estate funds, and even
    - cryptocurrency mutual funds.
    - index fund:
      - Different from other mutual fund, index fund does not hire analysts to pick stocks for the fund, the fund manager simply buys the stocks on the index in roughly the same proportion as the underlying index.
      - Usually, Index fund is cheaper to own and trade than other actively managed mutual fund.
      - Index v.s. Index Fund: You cannot directly invest in an index (e.g. [DJIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average), [S&P500](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp), [Russell3000](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/russell_3000.asp)), but you can invest in one of the many funds that use it as a benchmark, tracking its composition and performance.
- Exchange Traded Fund (ETF):
  - Different from Mutual Funds, ETFs trade on the exchange just like stocks, which means you can buy and sell them during the trading day.
  - ETFs can be either indexed (i.e. passively managed) or actively managed.
- Key Features in Consideration When You Plan a Regular Investment
  - Fractional Share: This makes it possible to invest a fixed number of dollars periodically.

    - "our industry is highly fragmented with many competitors"
    - "our stock price may experience periods of volatility."

    - the company generates a substantial portion of its revenue from just one or two customers.
